## Quantinuum Nexus Instructions

Quantinuum Nexus allows you to develop, execute, manage, and share all your quantum projects on one easy-to-use cloud platform. If you have been given
a Quantinuum Nexus account as part of this hackathon, please login to Nexus and open the Nexus Lab Jupyter environment. This environment will have all of the software packages that you need to start submitting jobs. Once in the Lab workspace, click on the Git icon in the left-most panel, clone this repository, open the example notebooks and work through the examples.
